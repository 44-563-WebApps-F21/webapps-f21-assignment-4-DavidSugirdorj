    <h3>Vera or, The Nihilists</h3>
    <p>VERA. Father, he will come back. 
      <br><br>

      PETER. Ay! the prodigals always return; but let him never darken my
      doors again.
      <br><br>
      VERA (_sitting down pensive_). Some evil has come on him; he must be
      dead! Oh! Michael, I am so wretched about Dmitri.
      <br><br>
      MICH. Will you never love any one but him, Vera?
      <br><br>
      VERA (_smiling_). I don't know; there is so much else to do in the world
      but love.
      <br><br>
      MICH. Nothing else worth doing, Vera.
      <br><br>
      PETER. What noise is that, Vera? (_A metallic clink is heard._)
      <br><br>
      VERA (_rising and going to the door_). I don't know, Father; it is not
      like the cattle bells, or I would think Nicholas had come from the fair.
      Oh! Father! it is soldiers!--coming down the hill--there is one of them
      on horseback. How pretty they look! But there are some men with them
      with chains on! They must be robbers. Oh! don't let them in, Father; I
      couldn't look at them.
      <br><br>
      PETER. Men in chains! Why, we are in luck, my child! I heard this was to
      be the new road to Siberia, to bring the prisoners to the mines; but I
      didn't believe it. My fortune is made! Bustle, Vera, bustle! I'll die a
      rich man after all. There will be no lack of good customers now. An
      honest man should have the chance of making his living out of rascals
      now and then.
      <br><br>
      VERA. Are these men rascals, Father? What have they done?
      <br><br>
      PETER. I reckon they're some of those Nihilists the priest warns us
      against. Don't stand there idle, my girl.
      <br><br>
      VERA. I suppose, then, t<br>hey are all wicked men.
      <br><br>
      (_Sound of soldiers outside; cry of "Halt!" enter Russian officer with a
      body of soldiers and eight men in chains, raggedly dressed; one of them
      on entering hurriedly puts his coat above his ears and hides his face;
      some soldiers guard the door, others sit down; the prisoners stand._)
      <br><br>
      COLONEL. Innkeeper!
      <br><br>
      PETER. Yes, Colonel.
      <br><br>
      COLONEL (_pointing to Nihilists_). Give these men some bread and water.
      <br><br>
      PETER (_to himself_). I shan't make much out of that order.
      <br><br>
      COLONEL. As for myself, what have you got fit to eat?
      <br><br>
      PETER. Some good dried venison, your Excellency--and some rye whisky.
      <br><br>
      COLONEL. Nothing else?
      <br><br>
      PETER. Why, more whisky, your Excellency.</p>
