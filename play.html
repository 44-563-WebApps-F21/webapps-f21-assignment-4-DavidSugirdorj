    <h3>VERA or, The Nihilists</h3>
    <p><h5><span class="vera name" >VERA</span></h5> <span class="vera speech">Father, he will come back.</span>
      

      <h5><span class="peter name">PETER</span></h5>    <span class="peter speech">Ay! the prodigals always return; but let him never darken my
      doors again.</span>
      
      <h5><span class="vera name">VERA</span></h5> <p class="stage-direction hover">(_sitting down pensive_)</p> <span class="vera speech">Some evil has come on him; he must be
      dead! Oh! Michael, I am so wretched about Dmitri.</span>
      
      <h5><span class="mich name">MICH</span></h5> <span class="mich speech">Will you never love any one but him, VERA?</span>
      
      <h5><span class="vera name">VERA</h5></span> <p class="stage-direction hover">(_smiling_)</p> <span class="vera speech">I don't know; there is so much else to do in the world
      but love.</span>
      
      <h5><span class="mich name">MICH</span></h5> <span class="mich speech">Nothing else worth doing, VERA.</span>
      
      <h5><span class="peter name">PETER</span></h5> <span class="peter speech">What noise is that, VERA?</span> <p class="stage-direction hover">(_A metallic clink is heard._)</p>
      
      <h5><span class="vera name">VERA</span></h5> <p class="stage-direction hover">(_rising and going to the door_)</p> <span class="vera speech">I don't know, Father; it is not
      like the cattle bells, or I would think Nicholas had come from the fair.
      <p>Oh! Father! it is soldiers!--coming down the hill--there is one of them
      on horseback. How pretty they look!</p> But there are some men with them
      with chains on! They must be robbers. Oh! don't let them in, Father; I
      couldn't look at them.</span>
      
      <h5><span class="peter name">PETER</span></h5> <span class="peter speech">Men in chains! Why, we are in luck, my child! I heard this was to
      be the new road to Siberia, to bring the prisoners to the mines; but I
      didn't believe it.<p> My fortune is made! Bustle, VERA, bustle! I'll die a
      rich man after all. There will be no lack of good customers now. </p>An
      honest man should have the chance of making his living out of rascals
      now and then.</span></p>
